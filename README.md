BigLittleBuy
============

BigLittleBuy, a cloud ready e-commerce platform. The ultimate aim of this project is to small support businesses reaching a local (or global) community for their products and services.

Ultimately this software should be able to host a single store, or any number of stores, given the right underlying cloud infrastructure.

This repository contains the API, Domain / data layer and related unit tests. The UI will be served from a different repository.

Tech Stack
--
The tech stack is comprised of

  1. A dotnet core (C#) API layer, including EF Core for code-first database design
  2. PostgreSQL for the database
  3. Redis for in-memory caching
  4. xUnit for the unit testing framework
  5. React as the front-end UI framework


We're starting small, but dreaming big :-)
